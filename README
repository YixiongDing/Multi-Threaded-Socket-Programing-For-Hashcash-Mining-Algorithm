The aim of this multi-threaded program is to interacts with other programs over a network (socket programming). Specifically, this is a server-based proof-of-work solver for the Hashcash mining algorithm used in Bitcoin. Some functions are implemented in the Simple Stratum Text Protocol (SSTP), which isused to format messages between clients and the server program. Used the POSIX pthread library for multi-threaded tasks.

Directions:

1. Use command 'make' to create the executable file 'server'.

2. The default port number is set to be 12345.

3. You need relavent client.c to send messages to the server, or use 'nc localhost portnumber'.

4. Maximum clients are 100.

5. Maximum work messages are 10.
